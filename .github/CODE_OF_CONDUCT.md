# Code of Conduct

At Sage, we believe that science is better together, regardless of race, age,
ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression,
religion, national origin, migratory status, disability/abilities, political
affiliation, veteran status, or socioeconomic background.*

## Scope

We expect all who participate within the Sage community, including all Sage
employees, contractors, board members, and collaborators, to abide by this Code
of Conduct when working with Sage, including in Sage’s physical spaces (i.e.
Sage Bionetworks office and events*), digital spaces (i.e. email communication,
SMS, video chats, JIRA, GitHub, Slack*), and in Sage related social media
channels.

## Our Standards

We require and promote the following behaviors as a Sage Bionetworks team member
and collaborator:

- Be welcome and inclusive.
- Participate in an authentic and active way.
- Respect the viewpoints and ideas of others.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Show empathy and kindness when interacting with others.

The following behaviors* are considered harassment and are unacceptable within
our community:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another
  person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory
  jokes and language.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying
  information (“doxing”).
- Sending, posting, or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation,
  race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before

- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## Enforcement 

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported in several ways. You may report directly to your manager or any manager
you feel comfortable with, you may contact Human Resources at
diane.gary@sagebase.org or erin.gerhard@sagebase.org, or submit an anonymous
report. Anonymous reports may be made using the Sage Safe Hotline by calling
1-855-662-SAFE (1-855-662-7233) or through the website [SAFEHOTLINE.COM],
referencing the Sage ID number 6882112080. All reports will be reviewed and
investigated by HR (Diane Gary & Erin Gerhard) and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. HR and all the
involved parties are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the reporter.

*This is not meant to be a complete list.
