services:
  # The 'setup' service runs a one-off script which initializes the
  # 'logstash_internal' and 'kibana_system' users inside Elasticsearch with the
  # values of the passwords defined in the '.env' file.
  #
  # This task is only performed during the *initial* startup of the stack. On all
  # subsequent runs, the service simply returns immediately, without performing
  # any modification to existing users.
